Design a Personal Portfolio Page using HTML and CSS (Bootstrap CDN if required)

Title
Design a Personal Portfolio Page using HTML and CSS. Use Bootstrap CDN if required.


Theory:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure content on web pages. It defines headings, paragraphs, images, links, sections, and forms.

Common structural tags used in a portfolio page include header, section, nav, div, and footer.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, layout, and responsive behavior.

CSS can be applied in three ways:
Inline CSS
Internal CSS
External CSS

For professional design, external CSS is preferred.

Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides pre-designed components and a responsive grid system.

Bootstrap CDN allows us to use Bootstrap by adding a link inside the head section without downloading files.

Benefits of Bootstrap include responsive layout, predefined classes, faster development, and mobile-friendly design.


Structure of Personal Portfolio Page : 

A standard portfolio page contains the following sections:

Header Section
Includes name, tagline, and navigation menu.

About Section
Includes personal introduction, background, and career goals.

Skills Section
Includes technical skills and tools known.

Projects Section
Includes project title, description, and technologies used.

Contact Section
Includes email, phone number, and social media links.

Footer Section
Includes copyright information.


Working Principle :

HTML creates the structure of the webpage.
CSS is used to apply styling such as colors, fonts, spacing, and alignment.
Bootstrap grid system divides the page into rows and columns for better layout.
All sections are arranged properly for smooth navigation.
Responsive design ensures the page adjusts according to different screen sizes such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.



Advantages :

Provides professional online presence.
Easy to update and maintain.
Showcases creativity and technical skills.
Responsive and user-friendly design.

Conclusion : 

This assignment helped in understanding webpage design using HTML and CSS. By creating a personal portfolio page, we learned how to structure content, apply styling, and design a responsive layout. The use of Bootstrap CDN improved layout consistency and mobile responsiveness.
